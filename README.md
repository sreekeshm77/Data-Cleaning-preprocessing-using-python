Project Title: Data Cleaning and Processing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tools Utilized: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Project Summary:

I undertook the task of improving the quality and reliability of a dataset used in data analytics. The project involved several key steps:

- Addressing Missing Values, Outliers, and Inconsistencies: I ensured that the dataset was both clean and dependable by identifying and resolving gaps and anomalies.
- Standardizing Data Formats & Correcting Errors: I worked on making the data consistent and accurate by standardizing formats and fixing any errors.
- Eliminating Duplicates: By removing redundant entries, I improved the datasetâ€™s accuracy and efficiency.
- Feature Engineering: I created new features to boost the predictive capabilities of the dataset.
- Applying Transformation Techniques: I used normalization and scaling methods to enhance model performance.
- Conducting Statistical Analysis & Visualization: I explored data distributions and relationships through visualization tools to gain deeper insights.

This project has significantly enriched my understanding of data cleaning and highlighted the critical role of data quality in analytics.
